Create a Laravel application from scratch which stores data about attractions.

All users should be able to view any approved attractions in the database.

Authenticated users should be able review the attractions, and leave a rating between 1-5.Â  Each user should only be allowed to create one review for an attraction, however they should be able to update their own review at a later date.

Users with administrator access should be able to add, edit and delete attractions from the system. They should also have the option to review and hide any inappropriate reviews.

Finally, include a page which lists the top 5 attractions ordered by their overall average rating, whilst also displaying the number of reviews the score is based on.

Any hidden reviews should not be included in the overall score.
